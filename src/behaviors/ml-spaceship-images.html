<!--Component: extend-auto-refresh-behavior.html
	Author: Pardo
	Purpose: ml-spaceship-images component is used as a polymer behavior in order to inject commonly used
	functions & properties within other components that may require the same functionality.

	In the case, it is used to preset spaceship profile image urls.
